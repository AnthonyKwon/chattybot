    cd chattybot
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Chatty is configured through three files in the `configs/` directory:

* **`general.json`**: For general bot settings, such as your Discord bot token and default locale.
* **`tts.json`**: For Text-to-Speech settings, like voice gender, speed, and pitch.
* **`gcp-credentials.json`**: Your Google Cloud Platform credentials file.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Authentication

You can authenticate with Google Cloud TTS in two ways:

1. **Workload Identity Federation (Recommended):**
   Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your credentials file:

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/credentials.json
    ```

2. **Service Account Keys:**
   Place your service account key file in the `configs/` directory and name it `gcp-credentials.json`.

### Running the Bot

There are two ways to run Chatty:

* **Production Mode**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

  This will start the bot with minimal console logging.

* **Development Mode**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

  This will start the bot in development mode, with more verbose logging.
