Please refer [CONFIGURATION.md](assets/docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for more details.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Running the Bot

There are two ways to run Chatty:

- **Production Mode** (Recommended for most cases):

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

  This will start the bot with minimal console logging.

- **Development Mode**:

  You have to register command as development mode first, with:

    ```bash
    npm run registerDev
    ```

  Then you can start as development mode with command below.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

  This will start the bot in development mode, with more verbose logging.

We also have [systemd unit file](assets/docs/systemd-service-units/chattybot.service) and [docker image](https://git.thonlog.com/AnthonyKwon/-/packages/container/chattybot) for automation.
