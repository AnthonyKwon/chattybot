## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Chatty is configured through three files in the `configs/` directory:

- `general.json`: For general bot settings, such as your Discord bot token and default locale.
- `tts.json`: For Text-to-Speech settings, like voice gender, speed, and pitch.
- `gcp-credentials.json`: Your Google Cloud Platform credentials file.

Please refer [CONFIGURATION.md](assets/docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for more details.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Authentication

You can authenticate with Google Cloud TTS in two ways:

1. **Workload Identity Federation (Recommended):**
   Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your credentials file:

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/credentials
    ```

2. **Service Account Keys:**
   Place your service account key file in the `configs/` directory and name it `gcp-credentials.json`.

### Running the Bot

There are two ways to run Chatty:

- **Production Mode**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

  This will start the bot with minimal console logging.  
  We also have [systemd unit file](assets/docs/systemd-service-units/chattybot.service) for automatic startup.

- **Development Mode**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

  This will start the bot in development mode, with more verbose logging.
